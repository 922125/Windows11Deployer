# Windows11Deployer

A alternative to the normal Windows 11 Home installer but without the system requirements. 


How does it work?
With a combination of Windows PE and dism, this program will load the normal install.wim file to any drive it can detect. 

Note: this files listed here are for the main software itself, not the full bootible version. That can be found here: https://blog.chaosityyoutube.com/index.php/2022/03/16/my-windows-11-installer/
